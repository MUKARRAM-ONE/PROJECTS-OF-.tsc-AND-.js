our Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list
to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


Solution:
Code:



// Define an array to store several examples of your favorite mode of transportation
let transportation: string[] = ["Honda motorcycle", "Tesla car", "Boeing airplane"];

// Print a series of statements about these items
for (let i = 0; i < transportation.length; i++) {
    console.log(`I would like to own a ${transportation[i]}.`);
}

// Define an array to store different types of sports cars
let sportsCars: { company: string, model: string }[] = [
    { company: "Bugatti", model: "Chiron" },
    { company: "BMW", model: "M Series" },
    { company: "Lamborghini", model: "Aventador" },
    { company: "Ferrari", model: "488 GTB" },
    { company: "Mercedes", model: "AMG GT" },
