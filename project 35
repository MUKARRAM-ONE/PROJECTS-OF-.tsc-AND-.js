Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to
print out the name of each animal.
• Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as
A dog would make a great pet.
• Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in
common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would
make a great pet!


Solution:
code

// Store the names of three animals in an array
let animals: string[] = ['dog', 'horse', 'bull'];

// Use a for loop to print the name of each animal
for (let animal of animals) {
    // Print a statement about each animal
    console.log(`A ${animal} is a very loyal animal.`);
}

// Add a line at the end stating what these animals have in common
console.log(`Any of these animals would make a great pet and on a extreme level in their loyality!`);

only for reading purpose
out put look like this:

A dog is a very loyal animal.
A horse is a very loyal animal.
A bull is a very loyal animal.
Any of these animals would make a great pet and on a extreme level in their loyality!
