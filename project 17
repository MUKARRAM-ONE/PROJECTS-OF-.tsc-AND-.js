question 17
Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time
 for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

• Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that
  you can invite only two people for dinner.

• Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each
  time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re
  sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

• Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.

• Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually
  have an empty list at the end of your program.



Solution:
code:

// Start with the guest list from Exercise 16
let guestList: string[] = ["Nikola Tesla", "Albert Einstein", "Galileo Galilei", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Marie Curie", "Isaac Newton", "Ada Lovelace"];

// Print a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner
console.log("Unfortunately, the new dinner table won't arrive in time, and we can only invite two people for dinner.");

// Remove guests from the list until only two names remain
while (guestList.length > 2) {
    let removedGuest : string = guestList.pop();
    console.log(`Sorry, ${removedGuest}, we can't invite you to dinner.`);
}

// Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they're still invited
console.log("\nRemaining Guests Invited:");
guestList.forEach(guest => {
    console.log(`Dear ${guest}, you are still invited to dinner. Please join us for a wonderful evening.`);
});

// Remove the last two names from the list to have an empty list
guestList.pop();
guestList.pop();

// Print the empty list to ensure it's empty at the end of the program
console.log("\nEmpty List:", guestList);
