Question 45
Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
stored correctly.

Solution:
code

// Define the function to store information about a car
function storeCarInfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...details: { [key: string]: any }[]): { manufacturer: string, modelName: string, details: { [key: string]: any } } {
    // Create an Object to store car information
    let carInfo = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        modelName: modelName,
        details: {}
    };

    // Add additional details to the car information Object
    details.forEach(detail => {
        const key = Object.keys(detail)[0];
        carInfo.details[key] = detail[key];
    });

    // Return the car information Object
    return carInfo;
}

// Call the function with required information and additional details
let car = storeCarInfo('Toyota', 'Camry', { color: 'red' }, { year: 2022 });

// Print the Object to make sure all information was stored correctly
console.log(car);
