Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet,
try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs
to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.



solution:
code

// Define an array
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Intentional error: Accessing an element at an index that is out of bounds
console.log(numbers[10]); // This line will produce an index error because the array has only 5 elements

// Correcting the error
console.log("All elements of the array:", numbers); // Printing the array to ensure the error is corrected


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
only for reading purpose 
output look like this:

undefined
All elements of the array: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
