 Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from Exercises 14 through 18, print a message indicating the number
of people you are inviting to dinner.

solution:
code:
// Start with the guest list from Exercise 16
let guestList: string[] = ["Nikola Tesla", "Albert Einstein", "Galileo Galilei", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Marie Curie", "Isaac Newton", "Ada Lovelace"];

// Print a message indicating the number of people you are inviting to dinner
console.log(`I am inviting ${guestList.length} people to dinner.`);

// Print a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner
console.log("Unfortunately, the new dinner table won't arrive in time, and we can only invite two people for dinner.");

// Remove guests from the list until only two names remain
while (guestList.length > 2) {
    let removedGuest: string = guestList.pop();
    console.log(`Sorry, ${removedGuest}, we can't invite you to dinner.`);
}

// Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they're still invited
console.log("\nRemaining Guests Invited:");
guestList.forEach(guest => {
    console.log(`Dear ${guest}, you are still invited to dinner. Please join us for a wonderful evening.`);
