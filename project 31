No Users: Add an if test to Exercise 28 to make sure the list of users is not empty.

• If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!

• Remove all of the usernames from your array, and make sure the correct message is printed.

solution:
code

// Define an array of usernames
let usernames: string[] = ["admin" , "user1", "user2"];


// Check if the list of users is not empty
if (usernames.length > 0) {
    // Loop through the array and print greetings to each user
    for (let username of usernames) {
        // Check if the username is 'admin'
        if (username === 'admin') {
            console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
        } else {
            console.log(`Hello ${username}, thank you for logging in again.`);
        }
    }
} else {
    console.log("We need to find some users!");
}
