 More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:

• Tests for equality and inequality with strings

• Tests using the lower case function

• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

• Tests using "and" and "or" operators

• Test whether an item is in a array

• Test whether an item is not in a array

solution:
code

// Tests for equality and inequality with strings
let fruit1: string = 'apple';
let fruit2: string = 'banana';
console.log("Test for equality with strings: Is 'apple' equal to 'banana'? I predict false.");
console.log(fruit1 == fruit2); // False

console.log("Test for inequality with strings: Is 'apple' not equal to 'banana'? I predict true.");
console.log(fruit1 != fruit2); // True

// Tests using the lower case function
let word: string = 'HELLO';
console.log("Test using the lower case function: Is 'HELLO' equal to 'hello'? I predict true.");
console.log(word.toLowerCase() == 'hello'); // True

// Numerical tests
let num1: number = 10;
let num2: number = 5;
console.log("Test for equality with numbers: Is 10 equal to 5? I predict false.");
console.log(num1 == num2); // False

console.log("Test for inequality with numbers: Is 10 not equal to 5? I predict true.");
console.log(num1 != num2); // True

console.log("Test for greater than with numbers: Is 10 greater than 5? I predict true.");
console.log(num1 > num2); // True

console.log("Test for less than with numbers: Is 10 less than 5? I predict false.");
console.log(num1 < num2); // False

console.log("Test for greater than or equal to with numbers: Is 10 greater than or equal to 5? I predict true.");
console.log(num1 >= num2); // True

console.log("Test for less than or equal to with numbers: Is 10 less than or equal to 5? I predict false.");
console.log(num1 <= num2); // False

// Tests using "and" and "or" operators
let x: number = 10;
let y: number = 5;
let z: number = 20;
console.log("Test using 'and' operator: Is x > y and x < z? I predict true.");
console.log(x > y && x < z); // True

console.log("Test using 'or' operator: Is x > y or x < z? I predict true.");
console.log(x > y || x < z); // True

// Test whether an item is in an array
let fruits: string[] = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape'];
console.log("Test whether 'banana' is in the array: I predict true.");
console.log(fruits.includes('banana')); // True

// Test whether an item is not in an array
console.log("Test whether 'watermelon' is not in the array: I predict true.");
console.log(!fruits.includes('watermelon')); // True
