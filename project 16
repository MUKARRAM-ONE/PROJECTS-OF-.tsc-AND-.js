Question 16
More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is
available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

• Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program
  informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

• Add one new guest to the middle of your array.
• Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
• Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.



Solution:
code:

// Start with the guest list from Exercise 15
let guestList: string[] = ["Albert Einstein", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Marie Curie", "Isaac Newton"];

// Print informing people that you found a bigger dinner table
console.log("Good news! We found a bigger dinner table.");

// Add one new guest to the beginning of the array
guestList.unshift("Nikola Tesla");

// Add one new guest to the middle of the array
let middleIndex: number = Math.floor(guestList.length / 2);
guestList.splice(middleIndex, 0, "Galileo Galilei");

// Add one new guest to the end of the array
guestList.push("Ada Lovelace");

// Print a new set of invitation messages for each person in the list
console.log("\nNew Set of Invitation Messages:");
guestList.forEach(guest => {
    console.log(`Dear ${guest}, you are invited to dinner. Please join us for a wonderful evening.`);
});
