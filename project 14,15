Question 14 , 15

 Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to
invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
someone else to invite.

• Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the
end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
the name of the new person you are inviting.

• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
in your list.


Solution:
Code:
// Define an array to store the names of people you'd like to invite to dinner
let guestList: string[] = ["Albert Einstein", "Leonardo da Vinci", "Marie Curie"];

// Print a message inviting each person to dinner
guestList.forEach(guest => {
    console.log(`Dear ${guest}, you are invited to dinner. Please join us for a wonderful evening.`);
});
// Print the name of the guest who can't make it
let guestWhoCantMakeIt: string = "Leonardo da Vinci";
console.log(`Unfortunately, ${guestWhoCantMakeIt} can't make it to dinner.`);

// Modify the guest list to replace the guest who can't make it with a new guest
let indexOfGuestWhoCantMakeIt: number = guestList.indexOf(guestWhoCantMakeIt);
if (indexOfGuestWhoCantMakeIt !== -1) {
    guestList.splice(indexOfGuestWhoCantMakeIt, 1, "Isaac Newton"); // Replace with Isaac Newton
}

// Print a second set of invitation messages for each person who is still on the list
console.log("\nSecond Set of Invitation Messages:");
guestList.forEach(guest => {
    console.log(`Dear ${guest}, you are still invited to dinner. Please join us for a wonderful evening.`);
});
