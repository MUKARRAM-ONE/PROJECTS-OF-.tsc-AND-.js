Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'.
Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?

• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.


solution:
code

// Define an array of usernames
let usernames: string[] = ['admin', 'Eric', 'Alice', 'John', 'Jane'];

// Loop through the array and print greetings to each user
for (let username of usernames) {
    // Check if the username is 'admin'
    if (username === 'admin') {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    } else {
        console.log(`Hello ${username}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
}
