Question 12:
 Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11,
 but instead of just printing each person’s name,
 print a message to them. The text of each message
should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.


Solution:
Code:

// Store the names of your friends in an array called names
let names: string[] = ["Asad", "Umer", "Haider", "Ali", "Amjad", "Waqas"];

let message : string = ", Do you like to play in our hockey's team or opponenet's team."

// Print each person's name by accessing each element in the list one at a time
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) 
{
    console.log(names[i] +" "+ message);
}
