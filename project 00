"I follow a consistent structure in all my projects to ensure clarity and coherence:

1. The first line of every project presents a thought-provoking question to establish the context and purpose.

2. Following the question, I provide a detailed solution that outlines my approach and methodology.

3. After explaining the solution, I present the code implementation.

4. Once the code ends, I include a line stating 'Output looks like this,' followed by the actual output generated by the code.

5. Finally, I conclude the project by reaffirming the output as the result of the entire code execution.

This standardized format helps prevent confusion and ensures that readers can easily follow and understand my projects."
